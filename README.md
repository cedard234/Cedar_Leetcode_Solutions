# Leetcode_Solutions

I use this repository to record my leetcode solutions. I will update it ~almost~ everyday.
Currently I code in C++. I will probably code in Python in the future.
The makefile is used to clean up the built files in my macbookAir. You can ignore it.
I code in VSCode and I use this book as a reference: [Leetcode101](https://github.com/changgyhub/leetcode_101). Thanks Chang Gao for the splendid explanation!
My code is based on Cpp standard 17.
